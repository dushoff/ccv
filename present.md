present.pgr was originally grabbed from cron and then modified to make the NSERC CCV.

NOW it is the main present.pgr (with info from CCV and cron and elsewhere, not really cleaned). In future we need to make current.PGR from it, with logic.

It also has months, and maybe other info, lost when we made the nserc version

We could also use logic like country dictionaries and so on so things can look more normal …
