present.pgr was originally grabbed from cron and then modified to make the NSERC CCV.

NOW it is the main present.pgr (with info from CCV and cron and elsewhere, not really cleaned). In future we need to make current.PGR from it, with logic.

It also has months, and maybe other info, lost when we made the nserc version

We could also use logic like country dictionaries and so on so things can look more normal …

Currently curating in jd.presentations.pgr

Need tools for cleaning; this version cannot be processed or uploaded, but the quick NSERC version in new.presentations.pgr was processed and uploaded.

Wanted are tools for manipulating and filtering .pgr; this can be attempted either with assisted python scripts on this side, or with tools that convert to and from tsv files, combined with dplyr tools. tsv is probably a better route to go, and I'm kind of questioning my obsession with doing things my own, weird way. Although I do love the cleanliness of engaging with .pgr files
