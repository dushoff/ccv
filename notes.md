xmldiff works well and seems to confirm that there is _no_ selection data in the XML!

What to do about colons in fields? I guess that's what the backquotes are for.

Let's try this:
* Call my downloads xml (and track them in case of disaster)
* Use them to make make down.yaml, and then PGR
* Edit pgr by hand (track)
* Use them to make up.yaml and XML

For the future we can do branching, but for now just have a single download.xml? But shouldn't really download again now that we've started truncated updates.
